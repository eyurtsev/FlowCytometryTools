FlowCytometryTools is a python package for visualization and analysis of high-throughput flow cytometry data.

* **Intuitive**: provides a simple programmatic interface to work with flow cytometry data
* **Flexible**: can analyze either individual samples or collections of many plates
* **Scalable**: simplifies analysis of high-throughput data using the power of `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ 

Who is this for?
=====================

FlowCytometryTools is for researchers who want to use the python programming language to analyze flow cytometry data.

The package is specifically tailored for high-throughput analysis. It provides an interface that can directly work with collections of flow cytometry measurements (e.g., 96-well plates).

Basic familiarity with the python programming languages is recommended.

You can find a few example scripts that load and plot flow cytometry data in the `gallery <http://eyurtsev.github.io/FlowCytometryTools/gallery.html>`_ page.

If you like what you see, then proceed to the `installation <http://eyurtsev.github.io/FlowCytometryTools/install.html>`_ page and then
to the `tutorial <http://eyurtsev.github.io/FlowCytometryTools/tutorial.html>`_.

Features
===================

- **Transformations**: hyperlog (hlog), truncated log (tlog), or anything you can dream of ;)
- **Plotting**: 1D, 2D histograms for both single samples and collections (e.g., 96-well plates).
- **Gating**: threshold, interval, quad, polygon gates
- **Subsampling**: easy to subsample to examine only part of a measurement and randomize event order
- **GUI**: simple graphical user interface to draw gates
- **FCS Formats**: Supports FCS 2.0, 3.0, and 3.1

Dependencies
===================

For more information about how to obtain these, please see the `installation
<http://eyurtsev.github.io/FlowCytometryTools/install.html>`_ page.

FlowCytometryTools may work with older versions of some of these dependencies, but if
you run into issues, please update the dependencies.

**Required Dependencies**

#. `python <http://www.python.org/getit/>`_ python 2.7 or python 3
#. `pandas <http://pandas.sourceforge.net/index.html>`__ (Recommended version: 0.19.0 or higher).
#. `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`__ (Recommended version: 1.5.3 or higher).
#. `scipy <http://www.scipy.org/>`__ 

**Optional Dependencies**

#. `wx-python <http://wiki.wxpython.org/How%20to%20install%20wxPython>`__ : Used for the FlowCytometryTools GUI.

Alternatives
===================

FlowCytometryTools is not the only open source software for performing data analysis on flow cytometry data.

So if you find that FlowCytometryTools does not suit your needs, take a look at the following software: 

* `cytoflow <https://github.com/bpteague/cytoflow>`_: API for python with a GUI
* `fcm <https://pythonhosted.org/fcm/basic.html>`_ : API for python
* `Bioconductor <http://master.bioconductor.org/>`_ : API for the R programming language
* `FlowPy <http://flowpy.wikidot.com/>`_ : GUI
* `cyflogic <http://www.cyflogic.com/>`_ : GUI
* `Flowing Software <http://www.flowingsoftware.com/>`_ : GUI

Changes
=====================

v0.4.6, 2017-03-26

+ FIX: edge case for inferring x-range for spline interpolation when doing
log transforms and with data the contains values in the interval. 
+ FIX: fix linear transform (kwargs weren't being passed correctly).
+ FIX: interval gate was raising exceptions for certain numpy versions (fix by alonyan)

v0.4.5, 2015-10-31

+ Sample fcs files now included with installation
+ Mostly maintenance (tests, configuration files, etc.)

v0.4.4, 2015-09-06

** Repository moved to github **

Enhancements:

+ added an experimental web-based backend for drawing gates. Use FCMeasurement.view_inteactively(backend='webagg').
+ col first enumerator for forming an ordered fcs file collection (Yoav Ram)

Bug fixes:

+ FCPlate.from_dir ID_kwargs match against full path, not just filename (Nick Bolten)
+ fcs parser can read larger fcs files and handles blank headers (Ben Roth)

v0.4.3, 2014-12-05

+ ENHC: Automatically determine bin location when plotting plates. 
+ Fix for Accuri V6 FCS (Ben Roth)
+ Fix for xlim/ylim when plotting 2d histograms

v0.4.2, 2014-10-08

+ FCS parser can handle more formats
+ Updated documentation

v0.4.1, 2014-09-13

+ Bug fixes for GUI
+ Now works with matplotlib 1.4.0
+ Added documentation and examples to gallery

v0.4.0, 2014-06-05

+ Updates in documentation
+ Added experimental view() function
+ Renamed old view() function into -> view_interactively()
+ Added queueing to help when dealing with large quantities of data.
+ Histogram plots should work with pandas (0.14.0) & matplotlib (1.3.1).

v0.3.6, 2014-02-11

+ Mostly updates in documentation

v0.3.5, 2014-01-19

+ Boost in speed for transformations on collections of measurements (like 96-well plates).
